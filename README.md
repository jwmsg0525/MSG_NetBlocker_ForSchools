This program is made by jaewan for Security School Netowrks.<br>
Nowadays, Schools' netowrks in korea are very weak for Unauthorized connection.<br>
Even, We can guess static ip forms by arp packet, or other PC's ip.<br>
So, We need what block the Unauthorized connection. <br>

If the mac address is unauthorized mac, It will send Block packet.<br>
